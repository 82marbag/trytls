    * *We did however include the mechanisms from PEP 493 so that
       end-users and system administrators could make different

    * *Since the system Python in RHEL 7.x is nominally Python 2.7.5,
       the default behaviour reflects that. However, both PEP 466 and
       PEP 476 have been backported (as of RHEL 7.2 and the
       corresponding CentOS release)*
