# Foreword

 * you mention this to be a cooperative work with others:  tell, which part you have done - and thank the others for their contribution. Thank Makke, Juha and others.

# INTRODUCTION
 * introduction is not the introduction of the technology - but setting up the scene for the thesis. Have you mentioned crypto? Have you defined infoSec?

## 1.1
 * which tools are doing what? It is your job to describe the state of the art in TLS. What are the risks? Are there known exploitations?
 * Check for any "weasel words". Eg, "few", "many", "main". Get precise by saying the "relevant", "majority", "minority" and give examples what they are doing, and how they contrast to other artefacts
## 1.2
 * "This thesis aims to gather information about the current state of the art backends and tools used in TLS-testing."
 * aims - will,
 * by - tell the method
 * tell the experiments and expected results

# 2. in action - The TLS/SSL protocol
  * "The TLS protocol provides a relatively good support for secure connections when used correctly. It can also provide seemingly ‘secure’ (i.e. insecure) connections if used incorrectly" - bring references!
  * seen - inferred (at the end?)

# 2.6 TLS testing
 * no personal pronouns!

# 4. Testing - "Case studies"?
 * Case study 1:
   * aims
   * test setup (what)
   * test procedure (how)
   * results section
   * analysis (what do the results mean?)
