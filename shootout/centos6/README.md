# TryTLS testing with CentOS

We chose centos5, centos6 and centos7 for this TryTLS-shootout
based on the [CentOS End of Support Schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS#End-of-support_schedule).

```console
docker run -ti --rm centos6
```

```console
# cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS release 6.8 (Final)
```
