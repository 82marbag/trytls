the following is mainly for linux users:

#Create new certificate

#you can generate a sertificate of your own using for example this command, ofcourse when creating more broken certs you will need to do a little bit more:
#if you are running the servers on your computer, you may want to choose the common name as localhost

-private key(pass phrased == encrypted):
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
-signing request:
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
-remove pass phrase â‰ƒ decrypt private key(so that when you start the server you wont have to use the pass phrase to du just that)
cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
-generate self signed sertificate
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

or you could use:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/256405/programmatically-create-x509-certificate-using-openssl


-openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days XXX

or

-openssl genrsa -out localhost.key 4096; openssl req -new -key localhost.key -x509 -days 3650 -subj "${MYSUBJECT}" -out localhost.crt

or any other way you want to do

#DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING IF YOU HAVEN'T CREATED THE CERTS YOU ARE ABOUT TO USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING
-if you no not share your private key, you should be safe to do the following
-but if you want to be more sure: please do not connect to any of the networks when testing and remove the certs after testing
-or dockerize the code you are about to run and do 'the same'(or similar) only in the container 


i.e at your own risk ... but should be safe(-ish)

#move certificates into this folder to make the certificates accepted:
/etc/ssl/certs

#you can copy those certificates into the /etc/ssl/certs folder by using for example this command:
cp localhost/certs/. /etc/ssl/certs/ -R

#you can find those sertificates using for example this command:
find /etc/ssl/certs/ -type f -name trytls_\*

#you can delete those sertificates using for example this command
find /etc/ssl/certs/ -type f -name trytls_\* -exec rm {} \;
