the following is mainly for linux users:

#move certificates into this folder to make the certificates accepted:
/etc/ssl/certs

#you can copy those certificates into the /etc/ssl/certs folder by using for example this command:
cp localhost/certs/. /etc/ssl/certs/ -R

#you can find those sertificates using for example this command:
find /etc/ssl/certs/ -type f -name tryTLS_\*

#you can delete those sertificates using for example this command
find /etc/ssl/certs/ -type f -name tryTLS_\* -exec rm {} \;


#you can generate a sertificate of your own using for example this command, ofcourse when creating more broken certs you will need to do a little bit more:
#if you are running the servers on your computer, you may want to choose the common name as localhost

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
