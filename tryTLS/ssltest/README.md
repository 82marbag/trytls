# Get started
To run for example the https localhost servers:
  * go to the folder ssltest/services/
  * run init script with correct parameters and set up the servers using docker-compose.yml file
  * read the readMe(ssltest/services) for more details

# Test your setup

You can test that the set up is correct for example with some of the following tests

  *curl https://localhost:100
  *curl https://localhost:101
  *curl https://localhost:101 -k
