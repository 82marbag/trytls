#Get Started

-to create services and servers(on localhost) run the following command

bash init 100 localhost https initialize cert protocol cipher
bash init 100 172.24.0. ftps initialize cert exit


-to start the servers, you can use the docker-compose file

docker-compose build
docker-compose up

-now the servers should be listening on ports 100 ... n
	-n is the next port of the next port to ne opened if you are to start more servers at the same time.
	.ie. the ports you may want to test your code against are: 100 ... (n-1)

-tmp folder(after running init -script):
	*server key = private key
	*server.csr = signing request, you do not need to care about this
	* *.crt	    = cert created (and usually also used in some of your servers)
	*server_info   = a little bit of info about servers and the messages you should be able to see if you were able to connect
		*ie. the configuration was supported
	*messages = "port & msg" = includes the ports listened and the corresponding message that should be returned if connection succeeded
