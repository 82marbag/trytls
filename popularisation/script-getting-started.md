Hi!

I'm FixMe and I'm about to tell you how contribute to TryTLS.
It's pretty simple. You just need, X, Y, and Z and you are ready
to follow my instructions.

You can run TryTLS on your on computer, or in the cloud. From cloud
services we like to use X, Y, and Z, as they play along nicely with Docker.

# Decide: docker or native

First thing you need to do is to decide if you want to use Docker, or
run TryTLS natively. With Docker you keep your main
computing environment free from clutter. But if you already have the target
you want to test installed, then it may not be such a big deal.

## Native

### Test one stub
First thing we recommend you to do is to test one of the existing stubs.
The stubs live <directory>. Here we see all the stubs that community has done
already. I'm going to pick X as it is installed on my environment.
