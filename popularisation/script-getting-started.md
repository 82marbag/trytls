Hi!

I'm FixMe and I'm here to tell you how to contribute to TryTLS.
It's pretty simple: you just need, X, Y, and Z and you are ready
to follow my instructions.

You can run TryTLS on your on computer, or in the cloud. From cloud
services we like to use X, Y, and Z, as they play along nicely with Docker.

# Decide: docker or native

First thing you need to do is to decide if you want to use Docker, or
run TryTLS natively. With Docker you keep your main
computing environment free from clutter. However, if you already have the target
you want to test installed, you do not necessarily need to use it.

## Native

### Test one stub
First thing we recommend you to do is to test one of the existing stubs.
The stubs live in <directory>, where we see all the stubs that community has done
already. I'm going to pick X as it is installed on my environment.

### Write your own stub

## Docker

### Test one dockerfile

<steps>

### Create an environment for your stub

### Set up our Docker-based backend
