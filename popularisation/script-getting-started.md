Hi!

I'm FixMe and I'm here to tell you how to contribute to TryTLS.
It's pretty simple: you just need trytls package, your development environment
and you are ready to go. 

First thing to do is to clone the repository.

<clone>

Then I'm going to install trytls.

<install>

It is time to give it a go. 

Trytls runner coordinates the testing. 

<run trytls without args>

When running without parameters, trytls lists the available test bundles. I'm going to test https-connectivity, so
I'm picking the https-bundle.

<arrow up to get the command line back, add https-bundle> 

Finally, I'll pick a stub for my test run. I'll use python-urllib2 as both Python and urllib2 are already installed on my computer.

<run the full commandline>

There you go! Now you have experience from running a working stub and you are
ready to write your own stub!
