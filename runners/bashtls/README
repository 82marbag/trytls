#Get started

bash init <stubspath> <" backend1 backed2 ... backend4"> \ 	#the spaces are of importance
	[language1&[driver]&[driver]..] [language2..] [langugage3..]

for example (change the trytls/stubs path to match the correct one):
bash init ../trytls/stubs " badssl-all" "python3&python3&python3_1"

If you want to run against the trytls backend also, you will have to do the following

* bash ../trytls/stubs init " badssl trytls-localhost" python3
* start trytls backend as instructed in the backends/trytls folder
* copy the certificates created to data/shared/simplerunner/certs
* run the bashtls runner as instructed above


folders:

* drivers: bashtls uses these to run the simplerunner and by doing so running the tests against choses backends
* shared: this file is shared between all the created containers
