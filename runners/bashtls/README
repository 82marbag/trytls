#Get started

bash init <stubspath> <" backend1 backed2 ... backend4"> \ 	#the spaces are of importance
	<language>[:stub1:stub2:...:stubN][&driver1&driver2&driver3]
* language = used language when running stubs
* stub1 .. stubN = optional arguments, if not given all stubs will be ran
* driver1 .. driverN = optional arguments, if not gived all drivers will be used

Example (change the trytls/stubs path to match the correct one):
1. bash init ../trytls/stubs " badssl-all" "python3"
* run all python3 drivers using all python3 stubs agains all(that are in conf-file) badssl servers
2. bash init ../trytls/stubs " badssl-all" "python3:python3-urllib&python3_1" "bash"
* run python3(language) python3-urllib(stub) using python3_1(driver) and all bash stubs using all bash drivers
 	against all badssl servers

If you want to run against the trytls backend also, you will have to do the following

* bash ../trytls/stubs init " badssl trytls-localhost" python3
* start trytls backend as instructed in the backends/trytls folder
* copy the certificates created to data/shared/simplerunner/certs
* run the bashtls runner as instructed above


folders:

* drivers: bashtls uses these to run the simplerunner and by doing so running the tests against choses backends
* shared: this file is shared between all the created containers
