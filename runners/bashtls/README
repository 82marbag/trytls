#Get started

##default settings

* language = python3
* backends = badssl, trytls-localhost

##To run the bashtls runner against default settings using default languages:
* docker-compose build
* docker-compose up


##Currently to change either the languages or backends use the following command:

bash init <stubspath> <" backend1 backed2 ... backend4"> \ 	#the spaces are of importance
	[language1] [language2] [langugage3]

for example (change the trytls/stubs path to match the correct one):
bash init ../trytls/stubs " badssl" python3

If you want to run against the trytls backend also, you will have to do the following

* bash ../trytls/stubs init " badssl trytls-localhost" python3
* start trytls backend as instructed in the backends/trytls folder
* copy the certificates created to data/shared/simplerunner/certs
* run the bashtls runner as instructed above
